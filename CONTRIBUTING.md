# Contributing

Before jumping in, please open a discussion to talk through the idea first. It helps make sure it fits the project and avoids wasted time or overlap. The goal is to keep the project simple to run and easy to use with each release, so it's important to think carefully about each new feature.

When suggesting or submitting new features, consider whether theyâ€™re likely to be useful to others. Open source projects often serve a wide range of users with different needs. Try to think beyond your own use case.

## Basics

- Pull requests should target the `dev` branch
- Changes must pass the full test suite before being reviewed
- One pull request per feature or fix
- Update documentation if your change affects how the project is used
- Add tests for any new features
- Use clear, focused commits with meaningful messages
- Follow the existing coding style

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `dev`
3. Make your changes with focused commits
4. Add tests, run `composer test`, and make sure it passes
5. Submit a pull request to the `dev` branch

## Code of Conduct

As the maintainer, it is my responsibility to ensure that all submissions meet the project's quality standards and goals. If you are contributing, I assume good intent and hope for straightforward and constructive interactions.
